**Open-source Education and Empowerment Platform for Rural Children and Youth in Uganda**

## 📘 About the Project

The HisGrace Learning Platform is a grassroots, open-source initiative led by **His Grace Orphans Ministry** in Samaliya Village, Masaka City, Uganda. This project aims to close the education and skills gap for vulnerable children and at-risk youth in underserved communities by delivering interactive, low-bandwidth learning through technology.

We are building this platform to empower learners where traditional education systems fall short—offering hope, skills, and opportunity using AI-powered tools, mobile-first content, and culturally relevant materials.

## 🌍 Key Features

- **Foundational literacy & numeracy modules** for children (ages 6–14)
- **Life skills and vocational training** content for youth (ages 15–22)
- **Adaptive learning with AI** to personalize learning paths
- **Offline-friendly delivery** using mobile devices and solar-powered access
- **Multilingual support** (English and local Ugandan languages)
- **Community-driven design** with local educators and leaders

## 🚀 Our Goals

- Reach 300+ children and 150+ youth in our first year
